Data Mining Projects (Sept 2025 – Dec 2025)



This repository contains my assignments and practical implementations from the Data Mining course (2025). The focus of this course was designing structured data analysis models and applying appropriate data mining methods to solve stakeholder-driven problems.



Overview of Topics Covered

**1. Data Preprocessing \& Exploration**

* Handling missing values
* Encoding (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding)
* Data scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)
* Comparing scaled vs unscaled data
* SMOTENC for imbalanced datasets
* Data augmentation
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualization for pattern discovery and model improvement



I learned that preprocessing decisions significantly affect model performance and reliability.



**2. Classification**

* Implemented and compared multiple classification models:
* Decision Tree (Gini Index)
* Naive Bayes
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting Decision Tree
* PRISM (Rule-Based Classification)



Applied concepts:

* Feature importance analysis
* Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
* K-Fold Cross Validation
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Model comparison and performance analysis



**3. Clustering**

Explored unsupervised learning techniques:

* K-Means
* Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering
* Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)



Applied methods:

* Elbow Method
* Silhouette Score
* Knee Locator
* Parameter comparison
* Clustering with and without scaling



4\. Dimensionality Reduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Used PCA to reduce dimensionality, improve visualization, and analyze variance explained by components.



5\. Association Rule Mining

* Apriori Algorithm
* Association Rules Mining



Evaluated rules using:

* Support
* Confidence
* Lift



Technical Skills Developed

* Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
* Data preprocessing pipelines
* Feature engineering
* Model evaluation and validation
* Handling imbalanced datasets
* Dimensionality reduction
* Pattern mining
* Structured analytical problem solving
